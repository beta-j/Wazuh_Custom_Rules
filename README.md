# Wazuh_Custom_Rules
A repository to catalogue my custom rules for Wazuh to provide valuable alerts for SOC analysts.

The complete rules file is found [here](/local_rules.xml)


I've also included a [Vega spec for a Sankey Diagram](Visualization-Sankey_Diagram_IP_Flows_vega_spec.json) to map IP Flows which I copied from [here](https://www.elastic.co/blog/sankey-visualization-with-vega-in-kibana)
